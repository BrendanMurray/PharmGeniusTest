How to setup test suite:</br>
Unzip the PharmGenius folder. After installing Google App Engine SDK for Python, run Google App Engine.</br>
Load folder into Google App Engine, and set to run on port 9080. Select run and a instance of the application should load in your default browser.</br>
On intial load sign in as an administrator and create a profile. After making a profile, visit the url localhost:9080/meanstackakalamestack.</br>
That URL will load a base set of questions that will allow the quiz to be run.</br>
From here the java files should run once loaded into eclipse.
